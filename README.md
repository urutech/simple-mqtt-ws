Simple mqtt over webscockets client

This is a simple implementation of a mqtt over websocket client written in JavaScript.
The motivation was to understand how mqtt over websockets work. All I could find were library based implementations.
They are most likely better suited for most cases. But maybe somebody finds it usefull to have a really simple client as a basis for own developments.
